       "'- Residential-specific cost logic:\\n  - Risk of rent loss: Set at 2.0% (€1,800), which is typical for residential assets with stable occupancy and diversified tenant risk. This percentage is lower than typical commercial rates and therefore results in a smaller deduction from sustainable gross rent. The 2.0% implies a sustainable gross annual cold rent of roughly €90,000 (€1,800 / 0.02 ≈ €90,000; ~€7,500/month).\\n  - Administration and maintenance: For residential property, these are owner-borne and benchmarked using residential norms; they tend to be moderate for administration and materially relevant for maintenance due to landlord responsibility for building fabric. Together with the rent-loss deduction, they reduce net operating income (before ground rent) to about €76,838.75 (€90,000 − €2,840.50 − €8,520.75 − €1,800).\\n\\n- Inflation application (CPI 1.2840):\\n  - Administration and maintenance were explicitly adjusted using the CPI index factor of 1.2840 (October prior year 128.4 vs. base October 2001 = 100.0).\\n  - Unadjusted base amounts: Administration ≈ €2,213.21 (€2,840.50 / 1.2840); Maintenance ≈ €6,634.45 (€8,520.75 / 1.2840).\\n  - CPI impact: The indexation added €2,513.59 annually to admin + maintenance (from €8,847.66 to €11,361.25), directly lowering NOI by the same amount and thereby reducing the capitalized building value. The rent-loss risk (2% of rent) is percentage-based and not CPI-indexed. The land component is not directly affected by CPI in the Ertragswert; the CPI effect works primarily through the building income side.\\n\\n- Building vs. land shares:\\n  - Building share 68.5% ≈ €630,200; land share 31.5% ≈ €289,800 (of the €920,000 theoretical value). This split is consistent with residential income properties in locations where land values are meaningful. CPI-driven cost adjustments affect the building value (via NOI), not the land value.\\n\\n- Value comparison:\\n  - Theoretical Total Value: €920,000 vs. Actual Purchase Price: €850,000.\\n  - Result: Purchased at a discount of €70,000, or about 7.6% below the income-based theoretical value, indicating the acquisition price is favorable relative to its income-generating potential despite the CPI-elevated cost base.'"
